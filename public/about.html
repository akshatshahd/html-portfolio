<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Akshat Shah, a passionate learner with a strong interest in technology, software development, and financial markets. I enjoy exploring topics like artificial intelligence, mutual funds, unlisted shares, and investment strategies, especially within the Indian market. I’m known for being curious and detail-oriented—often asking targeted questions to truly understand how systems and concepts work in real-life scenarios.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m pursuing my education at Vivekanand Education Society’s Institute of Technology, where I actively engage in research projects and academic writing. I’ve developed well-structured reports on topics such as AI in self-driving cars, ISO 14000 standards, and environmental management systems. My academic work focuses on clarity, simplicity, and depth—ensuring the content is both accessible and meaningful.</p>

<p>On the technical front, I’ve worked with programming languages like Java and Python, along with frameworks such as Flutter. One of my recent projects involved building a Flutter-based AI chatbot application, where I focused on modular development using components like ChatScreen, ChatbotProvider, and ChatbotService. I enjoy the process of debugging, organizing code for scalability, and crafting user-friendly digital solutions.</p>

<p>Alongside academics and coding, I actively research the financial sector—examining SEBI-registered platforms, analyzing investment opportunities, and staying informed about institutions like NSE, BSE, and companies like Data Patterns. I value safety, transparency, and compliance in financial decisions, and regularly evaluate evolving trends in the market.</p>

<p>With a mindset rooted in continuous learning and practical application, I strive to bridge the gap between theory and real-world implementation. Whether I’m exploring a new technical concept, writing structured content, or analyzing financial tools, I aim to grow steadily while contributing thoughtfully and purposefully.</p>
